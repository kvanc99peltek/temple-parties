/**
 * LastSemesterChampBadge — the gold crown for hosts who won last semester.
 *
 * Sits on the host line (feed cards + party-page HostRow), right after the
 * VerifiedMark, never in the category/HEADLINER tag row. It's a bare glyph,
 * no box, no fill behind it — the same "owner crown next to the name" idiom
 * Discord uses, which survives at tiny sizes. Gold (`temple-hyped`) is what
 * "#1" already means on the Ranks page; there's no glow, which stays
 * reserved for HEADLINER (DESIGN.md rule 1).
 *
 * Proportions: a 16px crown sits optically level with the 15px VerifiedMark
 * seal (the crown is wider than tall, so it needs the extra pixel to carry
 * the same visual weight). The two are designed as a pair — change both or
 * neither. No margin of its own — the host row owns the spacing (`gap-1`).
 *
 * Two modes:
 *  - `interactive` (party-page HostRow): a real <button>; tap opens the
 *    explainer modal, which names the host (`hostName`). The ::after pseudo
 *    pads the hit area by 6px on every side without changing what you see,
 *    because the glyph itself is tiny.
 *  - static (feed cards, the default): a plain <span> with a title tooltip.
 *    Cards are ONE tap target (the stretched Link) — a clickable crown there
 *    would steal taps from the card, so the feed just shows the mark.
