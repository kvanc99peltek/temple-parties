/**
 * VerifiedMark — the verified seal that sits after a host name.
 *
 * One inline SVG: a 12-scallop seal in the secondary light purple with a
 * near-black check, drawn in a 24-unit box so it stays crisp at any size.
 * (v1 shipped this as two stacked <img>s nudged into place with pixel
 * offsets — the check drifted off-centre at small sizes, which is why it's
 * a single vector now.)
 *
 * Sizing: 15px by default, matching the 14–15px host line it sits on AND the
 * LastSemesterChampBadge crown that can sit beside it — the two are designed
 * as a pair at the same height, so change both or neither. The mark carries
 * no margin of its own: the host row owns the spacing (`gap-1`).
 *
 * On phones (no hover) a tap explains the badge via toast; on desktop the
 * title tooltip does that job, so the cursor stays default.
